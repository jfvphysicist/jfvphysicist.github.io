				<h2>Hi !</h2>
				<p>
					So  this is the space were I can put everything I don't know where to put. This is basically that closet we all have in our house where we put random stuff.
					It's like Pandora's box: you don't know what will happen if you open it. And too bad for you, you're already on this page ! *Evil laugh* (cheesy, I know...)

				<h2>Chapter 2: My First Talk</h2>
				<p>On Friday 9th, 2018, I will give my very first talk of more than 15 minutes. Indeed, as part of an initative launched my fellow master students, I will give a talk on the Hubble tension (link to their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/324494424993792/?ref=group_header">Facebook page</a>). What will it be about, you ask ? Well, let me explain: <br>
				In 2016, a paper got published claiming there is something wrong with the expansion of the universe, more specifically, with how fast it expands. Since then cosmologists have tried to find how the problem can be solved. So during the presentation I will explain exactly what is the problem and then review with you what the solution could be. <br>
				You're interested but you think you're not smart enough, you say ? First of all, you ARE smart ! I mean, you are on this website so you probably are. And second, don't worry this talk will be as simple as possible, of course there will be a tiny bit of formulas but who doesn't like math, right ? So now that you are reassured, I can tell you where it will take place: Uppsala University, Ångströmlaboratoriet, Room 80101 at 17:30 Local Time. <br>
				If you really can't come, <a href="files/Hubble_Tension.pdf" download>here</a> are the slides I will use but beware that these slides do not represent all the talk's content, there will be a lot more. <br>
				Hope to see you there !

				<h2>Chapter 1: Creation</h2>
				<p>Although The Creation is a religious construct when it comes to our universe, it is no myth when we talk about this website. Because before me, this page and all the pages linked to it didn't exist. So I, Jean-François Vaduret, am the deity responsible for the creation of this website ! <br>
				Okay, enough with the religious talk already ! And do not worry, I don't consider myself a deity in the daily life (although it happens sometimes hehe). Anyway, welcome ! Welcome to to the beginning of my blog ! I don't guarranty constant content but it can happen that I want to post something here from time to time. <br>
				Don't forget that if you don't understand something or find one of the posts offending you can contact me via the Contact page (although it's not ready yet). I will be happy to explain to why such an article. <br>
				Happy to see you here !
